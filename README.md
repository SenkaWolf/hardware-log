# 🖥️ Hardware Log

A version-controlled archive of my PC hardware configurations over time.  
This repository tracks **current specs**, **historical builds**, and **peripherals** - all in one place.

Everything is organized **from newest to oldest** so the latest changes are always at the top.

As you can imagine, I can’t recall every piece of gaming or tech gear I’ve ever owned, so I’ve compiled this list based on what I can confidently remember. Some of the older details required quite a bit of research to jog my memory.

## 📌 Purpose

This repository exists to:

- Track upgrades and hardware history over time
- Keep a clean record for troubleshooting and reference
- Allow quick sharing of specs
